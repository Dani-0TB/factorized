# Factorized! A minetest Mod

Factorized is an in development [minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) mod that is planning to add automation with an industrial theme into to the game.

## What's the plan

At this point the project is just starting out. So there is no concrete plan. But, the goal is to implement machines that add automation for repetitive tasks like mining and storage management. Also the mod should allow item transportation in the form of transportation pipes. Those are the ideas we have at the table for now.

### To Do

- [ ] Create a development plan
- [ ] Get the project requirements
- [ ] Create the first prototype for blocks
- [ ] Have fun
